## Floating point arithmetic

This example shows how to use the `std::numeric_limits<T>` class to access information on floating point types.

It also contains two examples of computations in which the floating point arithmetic changes significantly the result:
$$ a = 1 - 3 \left( {4 \over 3} - 1\right)$$
$$ f(x) = (1 + x) - 1 \over x $$

### Building and running instructions

```bash
$ make
$ ./floating-point
```
